<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Music has become an integral part of every audio-visual creation</span></p>
<p><br><br><br><br></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many songs released under “free usage” musical license that you can use without asking for permission. If you want to use a song without permission, you need to understand which type of musical license allows you to do this, under which conditions, and where you can find this type of songs.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This article will guide you on your quest.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which musical licenses allow you to use the song without asking for permission?</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are basically two types of music licenses that you can use without asking for permission. These are the Public Domain license (also known as CC0 license) and the Creative Commons license (there are several types). </span></p>
<p><br><br><br></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Music in the Public domain</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A song enters in the public domain after certain conditions are met. These conditions depend on the country you are in, the country wher the music was produced. The thing you need to know about theses type of songs that it is normally free to be used. You can simply download it and use it right away in your production.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several caveats with this type of license. Usually the work of art enters into public domain 70 years after the death of the creator. For the mechanical rights, there is still no clear information when the song enters the public domain. So using a public domain has two disadvantages: first one is that the majority of the tracks will be older recordings, so the quality of the sound can be an issue. The second is that there will be almost always doubts when establishing if the work of art is in the public domain. Since I always advice to double check the associated music license, you may lose a lot of time to confirm if the song is really in the public domain. Many websites propose tracks that need to be in the public domain, but they are actually not. So I would be very careful with this type of musical license. It ;ay work well if you are looking for some classical music tracks, but otherwise, i wouldnt recommend it too much when looking for the right track for your production.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Music under Creative Commons license</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Music under creative commons license is very similar to music in public domain. To keep it simple, a creative commons license is a public domain license with added conditions. In order to use it for free, you need to fulfill certain conditions like: credit the creator, or, use it for non commercial purposes, or not remix the song etc. Every artist defines the rules when the song is released under which condition it can be freely used. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that you always need to double-check the creative commons license of a song you intend to use, and make sure that you can fulfill the required conditions for its free usage. For example, if you plan to use a song in a youtube video you intend to monetize, but the song is released under creative commons non-commercial license, you are not allowed to use it. But you can use the same song in a youtube video you don’t monetize.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where can you download songs without asking for permission ?</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free music platforms</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paid music platforms</span></p>
<p><br><br><br></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Music downloaded from music licensing platforms/websites</span></p>
